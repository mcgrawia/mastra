# Run.streamVNext() (Experimental)

<StreamVNextCallout />

The `.streamVNext()` method enables real-time streaming of responses from a workflow. This enhanced streaming capability will eventually replace the current `stream()` method.

## Usage example

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

const stream = run.streamVNext({
  inputData: {
    value: "initial data",
  },
});
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "inputData",
      type: "z.infer<TInput>",
      description: "Input data that matches the workflow's input schema",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "runtimeContext",
      type: "RuntimeContext",
      description: "Runtime context data to use during workflow execution",
      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "stream",
      type: "MastraWorkflowStream<ChunkType>",
      description: "A custom stream that extends ReadableStream<ChunkType> with additional workflow-specific properties",
    },
    {
      name: "stream.status",
      type: "Promise<RunStatus>",
      description: "A promise that resolves to the current workflow run status",
    },
    {
      name: "stream.result",
      type: "Promise<WorkflowResult<TOutput, TSteps>>",
      description: "A promise that resolves to the final workflow result",
    },
    {
      name: "stream.usage",
      type: "Promise<{ promptTokens: number; completionTokens: number; totalTokens: number }>",
      description: "A promise that resolves to token usage statistics",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Extended usage example

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

const stream = run.streamVNext({
  inputData: {
    value: "initial data",
  },
});

const result = await stream.result;
```

## Stream Events

The stream emits various event types during workflow execution. Each event has a `type` field and a `payload` containing relevant data:

- **`start`**: Workflow execution begins
- **`step-start`**: A step begins execution
- **`step-output`**: Custom output from a step
- **`step-result`**: A step completes with results
- **`finish`**: Workflow execution completes with usage statistics
